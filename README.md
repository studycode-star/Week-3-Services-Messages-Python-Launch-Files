Description of how it operates:
  -  Each node is responsible for performing a specific task and communicates with other nodes through a shared topic.
  -  I created 2 nodes: hello_world (publisher) and receiver (subscriber).
  -  The receiver will get data through the topic (the data is msg).
  -  I know how to create launch file (create XML and edit setup.py)
